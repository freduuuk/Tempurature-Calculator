# My **first Python Code** :smile:

> It's a calculator to calculate temperatures. 

> For example you have 10°Celsius and you wanna know how many °Fahrenheit this are. Feel free to use my program for that. Calculate the Units `Celsius (C), Fahrenheit (F), Kelvin (K)`

> I know its a .exe but you can see the code on my GitHub (Link will be placed here soon :D)

> If you have questions, DM me on Discord!
